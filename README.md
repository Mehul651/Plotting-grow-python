# Plotting-grow-python 

In this assignment, we were provided with the grow dataset Growlocations.csv which contained locations of all the GROW sensors as Latitude and Longitude and a map of UK. 
In the following repository, I have attached files containing Python code, screenshot of the output, expected output the dataset and the scattered plot of longitude and latitude which was put in on the map. 
There were a number of errors with the dataset like: 
a. Some location values are way outside the allowed values for latitude and Longitude
b. Some locations are not on the map provided. 
c. The labels of the columns have not be verified so may be incorrect.
which were taken care of and the expected output was satisfied.
